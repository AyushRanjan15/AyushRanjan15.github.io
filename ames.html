										<h3>Competition Description</h3>
										<p>Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.</p>

										<p>With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.</p>

									<h3> Summary of visualization</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>1-saleprice and overall quality is strongly corelated.</li>

										<li>2-garagearea and garagecars(Size of garage in square feet & Size of garage in car capacity)</li>

										<li>3-totalbsmtSF and 1stFlrSF(Total square feet of basement area & First Floor square feet)</li>

										<li>4-GrLivArea and TotRmsAbvGrd(Above grade (ground) living area square feet & Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms))</li>

									<p>After initial analysis I have trained different models and selected the one with overall best performance. In this competition we are using MSE as the measure of error.</p>
									<p> I have compared the following models: </p>
									<ol>
										<li>Linear Regression</li>
										<li>Lasso</li>
										<li>Ridge</li>
										<li>Decision Tree</li>
										<li>Random Forest</li>
									</ol>

									<p> Ridge regression model came out on top with lowest MSE on test set.</p>

											<h2>The App</h2>
											<p>After finalizing the model the next set was to build a front-end through which a user can give in inputs to the model and receive output generated by the model. To buid a responsive front-end I have used the following tech stack.</p>

											<span class="image left"><img src="images/project_image/ames/ui_tech.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

											<p> There was need of an API endpoint which will feed our inputs from front-end to the model and deliver the result back to out UI. Flask was used for the task.</p>

													After everything was responding perfectly. I started a Unix instance on AWS EC2 and with the help of NGINX server deployed my model on the cloud.
